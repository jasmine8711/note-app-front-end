# Note app

## The mission

Used my own API to create the interface. It is a big step for me to because full stack developer.
In this project we need to choose js framework from Angular, React and VUE.js, which i choose VUE.js.
The reason is vue is more modern and light.
I only touch the surface of Vue.js, but i have to say i really like vue.js, after this project, i also learned React,because React still very popular in this industry.
